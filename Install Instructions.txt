How to Install:

This has to be installed ontop of Valmod Overhaul. Ensure Valmod Overhaul is installed first, then put this on top of it, overwriting when promoted.

The files included in this can be interchangeably. This means you could cherry pick what files to use if you dont want every aspect.

items.xml:
This file buffs headshot damage and lowers zombie block damage against stone and metal.

spawning.xml
This file buffs the number of zombies that spawn in biomes and hubs.

entityclasses.xml
This file disables mutant zombies and disables day-time running, allowing the player to decide to turn off running altogether in the in-game settings. No puking, no climbing, no explosions, no super powers. (Note: Zombie brute, crazed slasher and feral will still be present)
